# subcalc-ios

This is the iOS app for the SubCalc web app. It is an app that hosts a built-in copy of the web app in a `WKWebView`. As such, this app also serves as a great example for how to use both `WKWebView` and `URLComponents` in a project. This app is developed and distributed by [Tenseg LLC](https://www.tenseg.net).

## Getting Started

To build this project the following must be installed on your Mac:

* [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (or `brew install node` if you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed)

Before the first build you must set up the SubCalc React app submodule:

1. `git submodule update --init --recursive`
2. `cd React`
3. `npm install`

## React App Considerations

**Do not develop this web app using the copy in this project.** Instead, clone it separately somewhere else and develop and test it there. When you have a stable version update the submodule to that, which will put it in a detached head state:

1. `cd React`
2. `git checkout __hash__`
3. Commit the changes to the submodule in the repo of this project

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. See the [version history](CHANGES.md) of this project for changes.
