## 2.0.1 – 4 February 2016

Added explicit statement about coin flips. Thanks to JB for her suggestion that we be clearer about the coin flips that happen when subcaucuses have the same remainders.


## 2.0.0 – 17 December 2015

It has been a long wait, but caucuses are coming up soon so we thought we'd better roll out a version that works with current devices!

* Now supports iOS 7.1 and above. 
* Added ability to remember multiple caucuses. 
* Support for split view and slide over on iPad.
