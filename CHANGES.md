#  Version History

## 3.1.3

Manny small updates to the calculator.

## 3.1.2 – 7 March 2019

This version adds the ability to print the table of subcaucuses. You are also able to save a PDF by long pressing on the preview within the Print screen.

## 3.1.1– 25 February 2019

This version has minor improvements, including:

* Added version number to bottom of screen and exports (thanks CT)
* Fixed an embarrassing typo on the welcome card (thanks SC, you would think we could spell "subcaucus" by now)
* Corrected the button color for the button to access the analyzer

## 3.1.0 – 22 February 2019

We've added the ability to analyze how many members, delegates, and subcaucuses were associated to given words used in their names. Want to know how many delegates are coming from subcaucuses that were formed around issues of the environment? That is the kind of question the new analysis view can answer.

Additional improvements:

* There was a brief flash of white when opening the app, this should now be gone
* Sharing data always had the data unsorted, now when sharing data it will use the same sort that you're seeing in the calculator
* Assorted improvements for accessibility

## 3.0.1 – 20 February 2019

A couple of small changes for 3.0.1:

* On smaller devices the yellow cards could be placed out of view, that should now be fixed
* Keep the menu and the subcaucus headers on the screen even when scrolling

## 3.0.0 – 19 February 2019

Caucuses are coming up again, so we thought that we would give SubCalc some love. SubCalc has been completely redesigned and rewritten from the ground up and includes these new features:

* Save multiple snapshots of meetings
* Duplicate a meeting
* Sort the subcaucus name and members columns (thanks CT for the suggestion)
* Hide the delegates column (thanks CT for the suggestion)
* Share snapshots as text, code, spreadsheet, or a link to the iOS share sheet
* Import snapshots via link either by viewing in Safari or using the Paste clipboard option in the app
* More detailed explanations of the numbers this calculator gives you
* Quickly reset the members column for the next walk (thanks CT for the suggestion)
* Quickly remove empty rows
* Now available as a public open source project on Github


## 2.0.1 – 4 February 2016

Added explicit statement about coin flips. Thanks to JB for her suggestion that we be clearer about the coin flips that happen when subcaucuses have the same remainders.


## 2.0.0 – 17 December 2015

It has been a long wait, but caucuses are coming up soon so we thought we'd better roll out a version that works with current devices!

* Now supports iOS 7.1 and above. 
* Added ability to remember multiple caucuses. 
* Support for split view and slide over on iPad.

## 1.0.1 – 4 February 2010

This version fixes a minor problem with the coin flipping process invoked when subcaucuses have the same number of people.

## 1.0.0 – 27 January 2010

Initial release.
