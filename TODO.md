# TODO #

* Add a way to communicate with the webview, maybe as outlined [on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15983797/can-a-uiwebview-interact-communicate-with-the-app)
* Icon and splash screen
* Better about screen?

# NOT YET #

* Auto-updating web code (concern about the security of this and App Store rules)

# DONE #

* 20151204 (efc+alex) Accomodate the status bar at the top of the screen. What do we do when the status bar grows (like during a phone call)?
