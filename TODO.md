# TODO #

* Accomodate the status bar at the top of the screen. What do we do when the status bar grows (like during a phone call)?
* Add a way to communicate with the webview, maybe as outlined [on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15983797/can-a-uiwebview-interact-communicate-with-the-app)

# DONE #

* 201511201 (efc) created first version of SubCalc to use the webview approach
