# TODO #

* Better about screen?
* Add app version, build number, iOS version, and device type to the support email

# NOT YET #

* Auto-updating web code (concern about the security of this and App Store rules)

# DONE #

* 20151209 (efc) Add a way to communicate with the webview, maybe as outlined [on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15983797/can-a-uiwebview-interact-communicate-with-the-app)
* 20151208 (efc) Icon and splash screen (no splash screen, actually)
* 20151204 (efc+alex) Accomodate the status bar at the top of the screen. What do we do when the status bar grows (like during a phone call)?
* 20151101 (efc) created first version of SubCalc to use the webview approach
